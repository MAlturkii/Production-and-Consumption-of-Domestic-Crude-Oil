📊 Energy Consumption & Production in Saudi Arabia (2017–2019)

This dashboard visualizes the energy consumption and production trends in Saudi Arabia between the years 2017 and 2019, using data sourced from the Ministry of Energy. The data is segmented by product types (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, diesel, LPG, etc.), measured in thousand barrels.

🔍 Project Description
The aim of this dashboard is to provide an analytical overview of energy consumption and production by type in Saudi Arabia. By comparing annual figures, it highlights trends in energy usage and output, helping stakeholders and researchers understand:

Which products are most and least consumed.
Which products are most and least produced.
How energy consumption and production levels have shifted over time.
The overall energy landscape in the Kingdom.
This project was built for visualization and data storytelling purposes, allowing for clear and concise comparisons using bar charts and donut charts.
